# CLAUDE.md — Multi-Agent Governance

> Physics, not policy. These rules are enforced by runtime hooks — violations are blocked, not warned.

---

## Roles & Permissions

| Role | Write Code? | Merge? | Zone/Budget? |
|------|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Planner | No | No | N/A (read-only) |
| Orchestrator | No | No | N/A (creates issues) |
| Worker | Yes | No | Yes (enforced) |
| Review Agent | No | Yes | N/A (reviews only) |
| Tester | No | No | N/A (runs tests) |
| Supervisor | Yes | No | No (escalation) |
| Universal | Yes | Yes | No (unrestricted) |

---

## Git Workflow

- **One branch = one PR = one merge.** Never reuse branches or stack PRs.
- Branch naming: `feat/<issue>-<desc>`, `fix/<issue>-<desc>`
- Workers NEVER push to main or merge PRs
- Review Agent merges when ALL CI passes (`gh pr merge --squash`)
- NEVER use `--no-verify` to bypass pre-commit hooks
- NEVER force push to shared branches
- NEVER amend commits already pushed to remote

---

## Labels (Communication Protocol)

| Label | Meaning | Set By |
|-------|---------|--------|
| `mault-ready` | PR ready for review | Worker |
| `mault-needs-fix` | CI failed, fix required | Review Agent |
| `mault-escalation` | Blocked — human needed | Worker (3 strikes) |
| `mault-zone-active` | Zone claimed by worker | Worker |
| `mault-agent` | Task created by orchestrator | Orchestrator |

---

## Key Conventions

### Three Strikes Rule

If blocked by the same governance check 3 times on the same task:
1. STOP — do not keep retrying
2. Add `mault-escalation` label with strike details
3. Release zone and move to next task

### Receipt Protocol

Workers post a receipt before session ends:
```
MAULT-TASK-<issue>-<sha>-<checks>/<total>-<timestamp>
MAULT-TASK-<issue>-<sha>-<checks>/<total>-<timestamp> | ws-<id>-agent-<n>
```
The second form shows the optional workspace/agent suffix accepted by the receipt gate.

### Zone Enforcement

Workers declare a zone (file paths) per task via `.mault/current-task.json`. Runtime hooks block writes outside the zone. One zone = one owner at a time.

### Budget Enforcement

Each task declares max files and max LOC. PostToolUse hooks block writes that exceed budget.

### Fix-First Protocol

Workers must fix broken PRs (`mault-needs-fix`) before pulling new tasks.

## Language Adaptation

### Language-Coupled Modules

These hooks contain language-specific patterns and need adaptation for non-TypeScript projects:

| Hook | Coupling | Adaptation |
|------|----------|------------|
| pre-write-test-gate | .ts → .test.ts mapping | Add target language test file conventions |
| post-write-hardcode-gate | JS/TS syntax patterns | Add language-specific hard-code patterns |
| post-write-monolith-gate | LOC counting, function regex | Adjust function detection for target language |
| session-test-rules | TypeScript testing pyramid | Replace with target framework conventions |
| write-preflight-stamp | npm test, tsc, eslint | Replace with target build/test/lint commands |
| pr-compliance-gate | tsc --noEmit, eslint | Replace with target type checker and linter |
| precommit-install-gate | Pre-commit config paths | Adjust for target language pre-commit setup |

### Language-Agnostic Modules

All other hooks (zone, budget, role, sprint, receipt, worktree, queue, bootstrap) operate on Git/GitHub metadata only — they work with any language without modification.

### How to Adapt

1. Fork the language-coupled hook file
2. Update file extension patterns (e.g., `.py` → `test_*.py` for Python)
3. Update build/test/lint commands in preflight stamp
4. Update session-test-rules with target framework conventions
5. Register updated hooks in `.claude/settings.json`
